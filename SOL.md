## Block Cipher Modes

### ECB (Electronic Code Book)

Encrypting the two images with keys generated by different providers yields very similar results.

### CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)

As the initialization vector is equal on all images, the first block (corresponding to the first few bits) of the encrypted image is the same for all images.

### OBS (Output FeedBack)

By switching quickly between the images, it is possible to see the tux and the glider.

By running the following command, it is possible an image that is the mere of the tux and the glider.

```sh
image-xor intro/outputs/glider-aes-ofb.png intro/outputs/tux-aes-ofb.png intro/outputs/glider-tux-aes-ofb-xor.png
```

This happens because both images are XORed with the same keystream. By XOring the two images, the keystream is cancelled out and the original images are recovered.

Both CBC and OFB are safe as long as we don't reuse the same key.
