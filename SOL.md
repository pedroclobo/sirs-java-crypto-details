### ECB (Electronic Code Book)

Encrypting the two images with keys generated by different providers yields very similar results.

### CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)

As the initialization vector is equal on all images, the first block (corresponding to the first few bits) of the encrypted image is the same for all images.
